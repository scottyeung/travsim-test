## Requirements

- [NodeJS 18+](https://nodejs.org/en)
- [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com) (or equivalent)

If you'd like to use the included Dockerfile then [Docker](https://www.docker.com) is required as well:

## Getting Started

Getting started is a simple as cloning the repository

```
git clone git@github.com:RicardoValdovinos/vite-react-boilerplate.git
```

Changing into the new directory

```
cd vite-react-boilerplate
```

Removing the .git folder (and any additional files, folders or dependencies you may not need)

```
rm -rf .git
```

Installing dependencies

```
yarn install
```

And running the setup script (initializes git repository and husky and installs playwright)

```
yarn setup
```

Congrats! You're ready to starting working on that new project!

If you'd rather run the commands above in one go, check out the command below:

```
git clone git@github.com:RicardoValdovinos/vite-react-boilerplate.git &&\
cd vite-react-boilerplate &&\
rm -rf .git &&\
yarn install &&\
yarn setup
```

**Note**: This project comes with two git hooks added by [husky](https://typicode.github.io/husky/). A prepare-commit-msg hook to run the [Commitizen](https://github.com/commitizen/cz-cli#readme) cli for those nice commit messages and a commit-msg hook to run [Commitlint](https://commitlint.js.org/#/) on the message itself. Commitlint will ensure the commit message follows the [Conventional Commits specification](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) (it will if you used commitizen).

If you wish to remove any hooks, simply delete the corresponding file in the .husky directory.

## Important Note

1. This boilerplate project does not include a demo. At most, a few utilities (types, devtools, initial home page routes) are included. There is no glue to get in your way when trying to modify the template.

2. Due to empty directories not being included in git commits, placeholder README files have been added to these empty directories. These README files contain simple descriptions about how the different directories in the accompanying folder structure may be used. As an example check out the [recommended component organizational structure](src/components/README.md) as well as the [recommended folder structure](src/features/README.md).

3. [Faker](https://fakerjs.dev/) is included to encourage more isolated testing and allow for rapid development of demos and MVPs. However, please make note that, [due to a bug](https://github.com/faker-js/faker/issues/1791), importing Faker from the main package (without a locale) will result in the entire Faker lib being imported causing bundle sizes to increase up to 2+ MB. Instead prefer [localized imports](https://fakerjs.dev/guide/localization.html#individual-localized-packages) as shown below.

   ```
   // import { faker } from '@faker-js/faker';
   import { faker } from '@faker-js/faker/locale/en'; // prefer localization when possible
   ```

   The imported lib will instead be around 600 KB. Nonetheless, Faker should **NOT** be used in production and instead be limited to testing and demos.

4. Starting May 2025, this project and its dependencies are set to be updated once a month or as issues/PR's come in.

## Local Development

To run the project locally in development mode, execute:

```
yarn dev
```

This will start the development server, usually accessible at `http://localhost:5173`.

## Deployment

This project is deployed to Netlify. You can view the latest draft deployment at:

- [Netlify Draft Deployment](https://692cb3742acb7a69d057e39d--travsim-test.netlify.app)

### Preparing for Deployment

Instructions are provided for deploying both with and without Docker. Both options still require a platform to host the application.

### Without Docker

Deploying is as easy as running

```
yarn build
```

and pointing your web server to the generated `index.html` file found at `dist/index.html`
